# Project Information: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Project Title
**Sentiment Analysis Using Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, and Classifiers**

## Course
IST 664: Natural Language Processing

## Student
Dawryn Rosario

## Summary of Work
This project involved building a sentiment classification pipeline using Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze movie reviews. The primary goals were to preprocess text data, extract features using both Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectorization, and apply classification models including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.

The project workflow included exploratory data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation. Results were documented and visualized in notebooks and reports, with Python scripts handling model execution and feature storage.

## What I'm Most Proud Of
I’m most proud of my ability to integrate multiple stages of a real-world NLP pipeline—from data cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation and result interpretation. I also learned how different vectorization techniques and classifiers affect sentiment prediction, and how to validate their performance rigorously.
